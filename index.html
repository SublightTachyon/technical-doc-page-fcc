        <h1><a id='Sloop'></a>Sloop</h1>
        <p>
          The Sloop is the smallest Ship type in Sea of Thieves. Choosing the Sloop at the start of the game will allow yourself and up to one other player to comprise the crew.
        </P>
      <p>
      Sloops are small ships, trading increased fragility for better maneuverability. With fewer Cannons than a Brigantine or a Galleon, Sloops may find themselves disadvantaged in battles of attrition, however capable deckhands can maneuver their Sloop to advantageous positions and take down bigger ships with careful positioning and firing placement. The Sloop has a single-masted split-deck design and can be maintained by just one person. The sloop has two decks in the stern with the upper deck for helm and sail controls and lower deck for the Map Table, Voyage Table, Weapon and Ammo Chest. At the bow, the upper deck holds the Cannons and two Cannonball Barrels, while the lower deck houses a single Wood Barrel, two Food Barrels, and a Stove. The lower deck also features a mattress occupying a space that previously held a Brig. Holes in the front of the Sloop will be below the waterline and take in water. Holes in the rear of the Sloop will be just above the waterline and only take on small amounts of water unless the lower deck is flooded or the ship is hit with a Ballastball. This means that the Sloop has an advantage over the larger Brigantine as it takes longer to sink. Since the Sloop has only one sail, it has a major advantage in sailing into the wind when being chased by larger ships.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Sloop can be identified at a distance by its single mast and mainsail.
        </p>
        </section>
      <section class='main-section'>
      <h1><a id='Brig'></a>Brigantine</h1>
        <p>The Brigantine is a medium-sized Ship type in Sea of Thieves. It falls between the smaller Sloop and larger Galleon in size. Choosing the Brigantine at the start of the game will allow yourself and two other players to join the crew.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Brigantine is a two-masted ship with one main deck and one lower deck. The main deck stretches from bow to stern and contains the helm and cannons. The Voyage Table, Map Table, Stove, Weapon and Ammo Chest and all resource barrels are below, on the lower deck.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Brigantine can be identified at a distance from the side by its two masts, or from fore/aft by its two mainsails.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Brigantine is much faster than the Sloop and much easier to maintain than the Galleon, making it an excellent choice for quicker voyages alone, duo or with a full crew. The Brigantine can also achieve the fastest speed of any ship by sailing perpendicular to the wind and angling sails to catch the wind. The Brigantine is also the quickest to sink as it only has one level, making it a high risk, high reward option for daring sailors. With a full crew, the Brig is easy to fix as the short distance between the lower deck and the upper deck allows for much faster water bailing. This means that while one person fixes any damage on the hull and another takes care of the upper deck, the third crewmate can potentially stand on stairs and simply throw water out from above.
        </p>
        </section>
       <section class='main-section' id='Galleon'>
         <h1><a id='Galleon'>Galleon</a></h1>
        <p>
          The Galleon is the largest Ship type in Sea of Thieves. Choosing the Galleon at the start of the game will allow yourself and three other players to join the crew.
      </p>
      <p>
      Galleons are the most difficult to sink until the water reaches the second deck, where it fills up rapidly. Galleons are armed with more Cannons, Sails and Cannonball storage, but are more difficult to maneuver than any other ship and require several crew members to be constantly working together. The Galleon is the fastest ship, with the exception of sailing against the wind or when sailing with sidewind. With four crewmates on the cannons, a Galleon can quickly sink just about any ship when positioned right. Expert sailors will have to make use of the two Harpoons to achieve the best maneuverability. Galleon crews have to watch out for any damage on the wheel, sails or capstan, as any damage to any of these will essentially make the ship helpless and needs to be tended to at once. The Capstan of the galleon takes a long time to anchor up, so a crew has to keep an eye out for enemy boarders lowering the anchor.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Galleon has one aft deck above the Captain's Quarters (where the helm is), the main deck, and two below decks. The Voyage Table is in the Captain's Quarters at the rear of the main deck. The Map Table, Resource Barrels, the Weapon and Ammo Chest and the Stove are located on the middle deck. The lower deck only houses the Brig. The mid deck is typically above the waterline and holes there won't take in water unless the lower deck is flooded or the ship is hit with a Ballast Ball.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Galleon can be identified at a distance from the side by its three masts or from the fore/aft by its three mainsails.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Galleons in The Arena game mode have all of the above features with the main difference being a team-coloured visual overhaul and the Resource Barrel contents (180 Cannonballs, 60 Planks, 80 Coconuts).

         <section class='main-section' id='Rowboats'>
           <h1><a id='Rowboats'>Rowboats</a></h1>
        <p>
          The Rowboat is a miniature vessel in Sea of Thieves that can be used by a single player to slowly travel the seas or to make hauling large quantities of Treasure easier. It spawns on Islands, and can be docked aboard the stern of Ships or dedicated locations upon the Sovereign docks.
      Where to Find
        </p>
      <p>
      A Rowboat has a chance to appear on any Islands with the exception of Outposts and Seaposts. Rowboats that spawn on Forts often get stuck in the heavy fortifications and cannot be retrieved as easily.
        </p>
        <p>
      Any rowboat left behind by a Ship will stay afloat at that spot. Due to this, Rowboats can often be found floating by Outposts, as any Rowboat docked on a Ship whose Crew has left the game after a turn-in will stay afloat.
      Variants
      Harpoon Rowboat
      Harpoon Rowboat.png
      A Harpoon Rowboat.
        </p>
        <p>
      Some Rowboats will spawn with a Harpoon attached above the Lantern on the front, making it possible to pick up Items or floating Barrels, other Players or latch onto and surf behind Ships, Skeleton Ships or even Megalodons.
      Arena Variants
      The Lucky Rover Rowboat.png
      The Lucky Rover's Harpoon Rowboat.
        </p>
        <p>
      Arena featured six unique variants of Harpoon Rowboat; one for each team. These would spawn attached to all ships at the start of each Arena match and would not respawn with the ship. The chests of these rowboats would always spawn empty.
      Cannon Rowboat
      Cannon Rowboat.png
      A Cannon Rowboat.
        </p>
      Some Rowboats will spawn with a small Cannon attached above the Lantern on the front. This Cannon functions identically to a Ship Cannon, allowing for a Cannonball, Cursed Cannonball, Throwable, Pet or even a Player to be launched from it. When fired, the Rowboat will launch backwards slightly due to a recoil from the Cannon.
      Soulflame Rowboat
      Soulflame Rowboat.png
      A Soulflame Rowboat.
        </p>
      During the Lost Sands adventure, all rowboats spawned with a Reaper's Bones paint job, a Soulflame Lantern on the front, and a special keg strapped onto the back. They may come in Cannon, Harpoon, or Unequipped variants. The keg cannot be detached from the rowboat, and is sturdier than the standard explosive, requiring more damage before exploding. The fuse of the keg may also be instantaneously lit and extinguished by interacting with it.
        </p>
      <p>
      Damage done to the keg is separate from damage dealt to the rowboat so there is no indicator of it's remaining health. Any time the keg takes damage, it will cause it to smoke for a short period of time. Kegs themselves require approximately 2 - 5 hits before they explode.
      </p>
      <p>
      Making the keg explode will instantly sink the rowboat; it will not remain at the surface for a short period like other rowboats when they are destroyed.
      Rowboat Chest
      </p>
      <p>
      Each Rowboat has a Supply Box on the back seat that can be used to store Resources.
      </p>
        <p>
      The Rowboat Chest has 16 slots that can each hold up to 20 of any Resource Items. The maximum Storage capacity of a Rowboat Chest is 320 Items.
      </p>
      <p>
      Every Rowboat Chest spawns with numerous Supply items (even Meat and Fish), which makes them valuable for restocking on Supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Rowboat Chest is still accessible after the Rowboat itself breaks, allowing Players to save any valuable Supplies in the Chest. The Rowboat itself will disappear within a minute, taking the Chest and all remaining Supplies with it.
      Rowboat Dock
      </p>
      <p>
      Every ship has a Rowboat Dock at the stern, allowing crews to transport a Rowboat across long distances. In order to Dock a Rowboat, a Player needs to row it behind a Ship until the Dock Rowboat prompt comes up. A Rowboat can be Docked from anywhere close to the stern of the ship, even in water, however it can only be Undocked on the Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Rowboat Dock on a Sloop is behind the Map Table, on a Brigantine it is behind the Wheel and on the Galleon the Dock is on the Balcony behind the Captain's Quarters.
      </p>
      <p>
      Additionally, all Outposts have a docking location for rowboats along the side of the Sovereigns dock.
      Features
      </p>
      <p>
          The rowboat is small enough to fit through tight spaces that ships cannot access, making it an ideal transport vessel for smuggling treasure.
          A rowboat has four seats arranged 1:2:1 with the front pilot seat facing backwards.
          Each rowboat has a lantern in the front that can be turned on and off and also equipped with Flames of Fate.
          Pets can be placed to perch on a rowboat.
          Should the ship be sunk, the rowboat automatically detaches, allowing surviving crew members to gather their belongings.
          A rowboat can be damaged into an unusable state, disabling all functions, after which it will sink, dropping any loot placed onto it.
          It has a health of 200 yet cannot take damage through weapons.

      <section class='main-section'>
      <h1><a id='Player_Pirate'>Player Pirates</a></h1>
      <p>
        Player Pirates are the Human Players of Sea of Thieves. Every Crew is composed of Player Pirates, who can choose their own goals and motivations on the Seas. A single server can have up to five Crews of 1-4 Pirates, making the possible number of Player Pirates within a single server from 2 to 20. As Sea of Thieves focuses on emergent Gameplay, every interaction between Player Pirates is bound to be different. Player Crews can decide to work together in Player Alliances or fight each other, sink their Ships and claim their Treasure for themselves.
      Identifying Player Pirates
        </p>
        <p>
      Player Pirates make up all of the characters in Sea of Thieves that are not NPCs. Every Player Pirate has a name displayed above their character, which designates their Gamertag. Pirates of your own Crew have a Green name, that can be seen from large distances. Pirates of other Crews have white names, which are only seen from relatively close distance. Pirates in your Alliance have purple names that can only be seen from a close distance. When using an Emote from the Hide & Sneak Emote Bundle, player names are hidden even further, only showing up when looked at right next to them.
      Crews
        </p>
        <p>
      Player Pirates can form Crews of up to four people. The maximum size of a Crew is dependent on the Ship size. A Sloop Crew can have a maximum of 2, a Brigantine Crew 3, and a Galleon Crew 4 Pirates. Players can either choose to play in an Open or Closed Crew. Open Crews will put together all Pirates who are either searching for, or setting up an Open Crew themselves. Closed Crews are only reserved for Players who are Explicitly invited by the host or in their friend list.
      Communication
        </p>
        <p>
      Player Pirates can communicate with each other in various ways. They could try communicating with words via Text or Voice Chat, or they could communicate with Weapons and actions instead.
      Text Chat
        </p>
        <p>
      Those who have access to Keyboards, can type Custom Chat messages to each other within the game. For those who do not have access to Keyboards, can use the Pirate Chat Wheel Menu to perform various phrases in the Chat. The Pirate Chat Wheel has messages for various situations, depending on the type of Items, Treasure or Equipment they are interacting with, or the location they are at. Chat Messages are displayed for all Crew members at all times, however other Pirates can only see messages that are posted in close range to them. The Accessibility Settings also allow Players to turn on text-to-speech and speech-to-text for Chat messages.
      Voice Chat
        </p>
        <p>
      Player Pirates can also make use of their Microphones to communicate with other Players. As with Text Messages, all voice communication is presented to all Crew members, or Pirates of other Crews who are nearby. The further away you move from an other Crew's Pirate, the lower their voice gets. Player Pirates can increase the volume and range of their Voices with the Speaking Trumpet Equipment Item. The Speaking Trumpet does not work with Text Chat, only changing Pirate Chat messages to all CAPS.Open Microphone is on by default and Players will need to turn it off to access Voice Activation.
